# Kubernetes-

a design document for a Kubernetes system that takes a backup for a PostgreSQL database within Kubernetes. This design document should capture how the system fits together, how you'd break down that system into smaller chunks of implementation, how that smaller chunk might be implemented, and other systemic-components you think we need before your code is merged into master and is delivered into our cloud production environment
